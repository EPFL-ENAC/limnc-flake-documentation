The work is currently under development, so it's a bit tricky to access the data, here's how to do it.

The development performed as part of the FLAKE project has not been integrated into a production environment so far, only in the development version, hosted at EPFL. The following guide helps navigate this environment.

Firstly, head to the EPFL-hosted development version of Datalakes, specifically to the [data view](https://datalakes.epfl.ch/dataview). Whenever you are navigating datalakes during the clean-up days, make sure that the URL starts with `https://datalakes.epfl.ch/` to access the new features.
